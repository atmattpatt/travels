# Sydney, Australia

## Been There

- 2018: Three nights of a two-week trip to Australia and New Zealand

## Get Around

- Take the train from the airport. It feels a bit pricey, but it's cheaper than a cab and it runs on a frequent enough schedule.
- The Central Business District (CBD) is very walkable.

## See / Do

- **Bondi Beach** - The north end of the beach is less crowded, less touristy, and has more LGBTQ beachgoers.
- **Royal Botanical Gardens** - If for no other reason than to get your photo of the Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge.
- **The Rocks** - A cool little neighborhood filled with galleries, shops, and restaurants.
- [**WILD LIFE Sydney Zoo**](https://www.wildlifesydney.com.au) - Lots of cool animal exhibits, including up-close views of kangaroos and koalas. You can pay extra to have your photo taken with the koalas.

## Eat

### Breakfast

- CBD: [The Grounds of the City](https://thegroundscity.com.au) - One of the best breakfast places I've ever been to. They also brew and bottle their own cold brew daily.

### Dinner

- Surry Hills: [Dead Ringer](https://deadringer.wtf) - Small menu, but the food is very well prepared.

## Pro Tips

- Generally speaking, walk on the left just as you would drive on the left. But you should expect that many tourists will still try to walk on the right.
- You will see signs for many a "VIP Lounge". These are video poker rooms, but it's illegal to advertise them as such.
- Credit cards are widely accepted, and many places will accept American Express. Some places will add a small surcharge for paying with a credit card.
