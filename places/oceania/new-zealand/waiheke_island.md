# Waiheke Island, New Zealand

IPA: /waɪ' hε ki/

## Been There

- 2018: Two day trips during a trip to Auckland

## Get Around

- Take the ferry from Auckland; it takes about 30 minutes.
- There is a hop-on, hop-off bus that you can purchase once on the island. It operates every 30 minutes, but it is rather expensive and stops service around 5pm.
- Taxis are available on the island and may accept credit cards, but will prefer cash. They are pricey: a taxi from the ferry terminal to the center of the island and back will cost about the same as the hop-on, hop-off bus but provides greater flexibility.
- It is easy to back to the ferry from Oneroa or Cable Bay.

## See / Do

- Vineyards - Each charges a nominal tasting fee that is fairly cheap in USD, but this may be waived with the purchase of wine bottles.
  - [**Batch Winery**](https://www.batchwinery.com) - At a high elevation, Batch gives you some of the best views of Waiheke Island and the surrounding area. They are the only winery on the island producing sparkling wine.
  - [**Cable Bay**](https://cablebay.nz) - A bit more commercial, but good wines nonetheless. The cellar door staff may even let you taste wines outside of the daily tasting menu. Walking distance to Jurassic Rdige and the ferry.
  - [**Jurassic Ridge**](https://www.jurassicridge.co.nz) - By far **my favorite**. Natural, organic wines. You may be lucky enough to have Lance, the founder, at the cellar door. He can talk to you for hours about the wine, the process they use, the global market for wine, how different vintages compare, really just about anything related to wine. And the wines themselves are excellent! Walking distance to Cable Bay.
  - [**Stonyridge**](http://www.stonyridge.com) - Good scenery and a great outdoor space to chill while you taste. Right next to Te Motu.
  - [**Te Motu**](https://temotu.co.nz) - Knowledgeable cellar door staff that can tell you the story behind their wines. Right next Stonyridge.

## Pro Tips

- Credit cards are accepted at the vineyards. Taxi drivers may accept credit cards but will prefer cash.
- If purchasing wine to bring back home, also purchase a wine skin to protect the bottle in transit.
