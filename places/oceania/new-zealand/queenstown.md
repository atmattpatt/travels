# Queenstown, New Zealand

## Been There

- 2018: Four nights of a two-week trip to Australia and New Zealand

## Get Around

- The heart of the city is walkable, but you may have to navigate some _very steep_ hills outside of the town center.
- Renting a car is the easiest way to explore outside of town.
  - Roads in the area tend to be very well-maintained. They are very windy and hilly, though, so it is important to drive with care.
  - There are usually guardrails or cables around drop-offs.
  - One-lane bridges are common and signs will indicate which direction of traffic must yield the right-of-way.
  - In some places, two-lane roads may be reduced in width but may maintain two-way traffic. Use extreme care.

## See / Do

- **Milford Sound**, which is technically a fjord, not a sound
  - You can take a two-hour boat tour through Milford Sound itself.
  - There is no direct road from Queenstown to Milford Sound; it is a [multi-hour drive](https://goo.gl/maps/J4fQrn91nnt). The drive is very scenic, though.
  - You can also fly to/from Milfound Sound on [Air Milford](https://www.airmilford.co.nz). The flight through the Southern Alps is also very scenic.
  - I recommend taking a coach bus to the sound and flying back to Queenstown.

- Hiking
  - [Bob's Cove Track](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/new-zealand/otago-region/bobs-cove-track) [<img src="https://www.strava.com/favicon.ico" alt="strava" height=16>](https://www.strava.com/activities/2019067512) - An easy hike along the water. Aim to get there early if you want decent parking.
  - [Tiki Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/new-zealand/otago-region/tiki-trail) [<img src="https://www.strava.com/favicon.ico" alt="strava" height=16>](https://www.strava.com/activities/2019284967) - Take the gondola up and hike down, or vice versa.

- Wine Tours - Don't drink and drive; let someone else drive
  - [**Queenstown Wine Trail Food and Wine Tour**](https://www.queenstownwinetrail.co.nz) - Highly recommanded. Takes you to three different cellar doors and provides lunch. We tasted 24 different wines during the tour, so having a driver was very important!

- Wineries
  - [**Gibbston Valley**](https://www.gibbstonvalley.com) - The oldest winery in the region (though not the first, as they claim). Very commercial, but they produce good wines and have a wine cave that is part of the tour.
  - [**Kinross**](https://www.kinrosscottages.co.nz) - Cellar door for many nearby vineyards with very friendly staff. Their own wine is delicious as well.
  - [**Mt. Rosa Wines**](https://www.mtrosa.co.nz) - Very good wines and a lengthy tasting list; expect to taste twice as many wines as other places.
